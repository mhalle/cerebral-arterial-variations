## Common Carotid Arteries

### Normal Anatomy
The right common carotid arises from the brachiocephalic trunk; the left common carotid arises directly from the aortic arch. Each ascends in the neck and bifurcates into internal and external carotid arteries, typically at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage.

### Variations

#### Origin Variations

**Right Common Carotid:**
- May be absent
- May arise as second branch of aortic arch (instead of from brachiocephalic)
- May arise from common stem with left common carotid from aorta
- When arising from aorta, may run behind trachea or esophagus to right neck
- Origin may be above or below usual point depending on brachiocephalic bifurcation level

**Left Common Carotid:**
- More variable than right
- May arise from brachiocephalic trunk
- May arise from common stem with right common carotid
- When right subclavian is separate aortic branch, the two carotids most frequently arise by common trunk

#### Bicarotid Trunk
Both common carotids may arise from a common stem from the aorta.

#### Course Variations
- May follow very tortuous course
- May form one or more distinct loops in neck
- May obliquely cross lower trachea above sternum level

#### Bifurcation Level Variations

| Level | Right Incidence | Poynter Data |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| High (hyoid or styloid) | 5/295 (Quain) | 3/400 |
| Low (cricoid or below) | 10/295 (Quain) | 18/400 |
| Very low (within 3.7 cm of origin) | Rare | - |

- High bifurcation is more common than low
- Bifurcation can occur as high as hyoid bone or even styloid process
- Bifurcation can occur as low as cricoid cartilage

#### Non-Bifurcating Carotid
As a very rare occurrence:
- Carotid may ascend without dividing into two usual branches
- Either external or internal carotid may be absent
- May provide branches usually derived from external carotid as it ascends

#### Absence
- Common carotid may be absent
- External and internal carotids then arise directly from aortic arch or brachiocephalic

#### Unusual Branches
The common carotid may provide branches usually derived from external carotid:
- Superior thyroid artery
- Thyroidea ima
- Vertebral artery (rare)
- Inferior thyroid artery
- Ascending laryngeal artery
- Esophageal artery

#### Vagus Nerve Relationship
The vagus nerve may run **in front of** the common carotid artery instead of behind it.

### Collateral Circulation After Ligation

Collateral circulation is maintained by:

**To Internal Carotid Territory:**
- Vertebral arteries via Circle of Willis
- Contralateral internal carotid via Circle of Willis

**To External Carotid Territory:**
- Subclavian via superior/inferior thyroid anastomoses
- Subclavian via occipital-ascending cervical-vertebral-deep cervical anastomoses
- Contralateral external carotid via midline anastomoses:
  - Superior thyroid arteries
  - Lingual arteries
  - Facial arteries
  - Superficial temporal arteries
  - Occipital arteries
- Ophthalmic-angular anastomosis
- Deep cervical-descending occipital anastomosis (deep at back of neck)

## External Carotid Artery

### Normal Anatomy
The external carotid artery supplies structures of the face, scalp, and neck. It typically gives off eight named branches before terminating as the superficial temporal and maxillary arteries.

### Variations

#### Origin Variations
See Common Carotid variations above.

#### Absence
- May be absent unilaterally or bilaterally
- When unilaterally absent:
  - Branches usually derived from it arise from upward continuation of common trunk
  - Or supplied from contralateral vessel

#### Course Variations
- Sometimes located superficially
- May run lateral to stylohyoid muscle
- May run between posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid

#### Ring Formation
A curious variation: external carotid composed of two separate trunks that unite behind condylar process of mandible forming an **anulus** from which various branches arise.

#### Branch Variations

**Number of Branches:**
- May be diminished or increased
- When increased: arise as common stem or by addition of branches not usually from ECA

**Common Stem Origins:**
- All branches may arise close together from common point just above origin

**Unusual Branches from ECA:**
- Accessory superior thyroid
- Dorsal lingual
- Accessory ascending pharyngeal
- Sternomastoid branch (usually from superior thyroid)

#### Specific Branch Variation Incidences

**Ascending Pharyngeal:**
| Origin | Incidence |
|--------|-----------|
| External carotid or CCA bifurcation | 65-80% |
| Occipital artery | 14-20% |
| Common carotid | 7-9% |

**Lingual Artery:**
- Arises from linguofacial trunk (common with facial): 10-20%

**Thyrolinguofacial Trunk:**
- Rare combination branch of superior thyroid, lingual, and facial arteries
