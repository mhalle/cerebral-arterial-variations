## Overview

During embryologic development, several transient arterial connections exist between the carotid and vertebrobasilar systems. These normally regress but occasionally persist into adult life.

Four main embryonic cerebral arteries directly connect the carotid and basilar arteries:

1. **Trigeminal artery** - most common persistent type
2. **Otic artery**
3. **Hypoglossal artery**
4. **Proatlantal artery**

---

## Primitive Trigeminal Artery

### Incidence
- Most common persistent carotid-basilar anastomotic channel observed in adult life
- **0.1 to 0.6%** of consecutive cerebral angiograms or autopsy cases

### Anatomy
- Connects the cavernous or precavernous internal carotid artery to the basilar artery
- Named for its relationship to the trigeminal nerve

### Clinical Associations
- May be associated with other anomalies of the Circle of Willis
- Can be associated with aneurysms
- May cause trigeminal neuralgia due to vascular compression
- Important to recognize during endovascular procedures

### Variants
- **Trigeminal artery variant**: Internal carotid may give rise to cerebellar arteries directly
- In 5,500 angiographic studies, 11 cerebellar arteries were found arising directly from the ICA
- Nine additional embryonic cerebral arteries were also found
- These cerebellar arteries from ICA are considered persistent primitive trigeminal artery variants

---

## Hypoglossal Artery

### Anatomy
- Connects the cervical internal carotid artery to the vertebrobasilar system
- Enters the skull through the **hypoglossal canal**

### Clinical Presentation
- Extremely rare
- May be encountered during surgery involving the hypoglossal canal
- Relevant for skull base surgery planning

### Case Examples
- In one documented case: rudimentary vertebral artery stopped short of skull; basilar arose as branch of ICA in neck and entered cranial cavity through hypoglossal canal
- The contralateral vertebral artery ended as PICA

---

## Otic Artery

### Anatomy
- Theoretical persistent embryonic connection
- Would course through the internal auditory canal

### Clinical Significance
- Extremely rare
- Least commonly reported of the four embryonic arteries

---

## Proatlantal Artery

### Anatomy
Two types described:

**Type I (Proatlantal intersegmental artery):**
- Arises from ICA
- Courses posteriorly to join vertebral artery

**Type II:**
- Arises from external carotid artery
- Courses to vertebral artery

### Clinical Significance
- May be associated with absence of ipsilateral vertebral artery
- Important for surgical planning in upper cervical region

---

## Other Persistent Embryologic Vessels

### Hyaloid Artery
- Embryonic vessel supplying the developing lens
- Normally regresses before birth
- Persistence results in **persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous**
- May be partial (Mittendorf dot) or complete

### Stapedial Artery
- Embryonic vessel that passes through the stapes
- Normally regresses; middle meningeal artery takes over its territory
- Persistence may be associated with:
  - Absent foramen spinosum
  - Anomalous course of middle meningeal artery
  - Pulsatile tinnitus

---

## Embryologic Background

### Development Timeline
The embryonic carotid-basilar anastomoses form during weeks 4-5 of development and normally regress as the posterior communicating arteries develop and mature.

### Regression Pattern

| Artery | Regression Period |
|--------|-------------------|
| Trigeminal | 5-6 weeks |
| Otic | 5-6 weeks |
| Hypoglossal | 6-7 weeks |
| Proatlantal | Variable |

### Factors in Persistence
The exact cause of persistence is unknown but may relate to:
- Failure of normal regression
- Hemodynamic factors favoring maintenance
- Hypoplasia of normal posterior communicating system
- Genetic factors

---

## Clinical Implications

### Imaging Recognition
- May be encountered on routine CT/MR angiography
- Important to recognize to avoid confusion with pathology
- May affect interpretation of cerebrovascular disease

### Surgical/Interventional Relevance
- Must be considered in surgical planning for skull base procedures
- Important for endovascular navigation
- May provide alternative access routes
- Risk of inadvertent injury if not recognized

### Associated Conditions
- Aneurysms (increased incidence at connection points)
- Other vascular anomalies
- Trigeminal neuralgia (compression by trigeminal artery)
